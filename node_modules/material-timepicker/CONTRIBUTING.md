## Issues

Issues can be questions, suggestions, or bug reports. As stated elsewhere this is my first vanilla JS DOM module, so it's likely i didn't do things the best or most proper way.

## Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests please include the following where applicable:

- unit tests
- examples (either edit the index.html file or use codepen, plunker, etc...)
- documentation updates
- a thoughtful but consice commit message

Also please rebase against the current master branch before submitting to make reviewing easier.

Thanks for your time and effort!
